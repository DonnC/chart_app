# chart_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
This is a chart of the current price of the USD to the EUR, in a 5 minute timeframe. Using this continuously changing price information, you've been tasked with the following actionable items to be completed for this project:


1. Connect to a forex price feed (in this case, OANDA has been selected)

2. Monitor and record the last 100 price instances for a time period of your choice from the EUR/USD currency pair

3. Using your recorded information, display the latest high price, the latest low price, and the average closing price for these 100 price instances on a web page

4. Using a small timeframe (such as a 5 second timeframe) for the price instances and automatically update your interface

5. Adding additional metrics (for example: average difference between high and low prices) to your interface

6. Creative design for your interface


There is really no wrong or right system or development choice here, it's more about assessing your overall comfort with handling a system requirement which would involve several aspects of architecture, creativity and development.
